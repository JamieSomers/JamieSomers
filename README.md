- 👋 Hi, I’m Jamie Somers a Physics PhD student at Trinity College Dublin (TCD). This github serves mostly as a place to store all of the python & C++ programmes I have developed during my undergrad.  

- 👀 I’m interested in Photonics & Optics however my repositories will cover a broad range of physics phenomenon which reflects the broad range of topics I have studied during my time at university.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Optical modelling, Data interpolation and creating Figure's of Merit (FoM) using colormaps of Transmission and Resistivity data. These are all python programmes I am writing as part of an Undergraduate Summer Research Internship offered by the School of Physics at my university which is titled "Automated Data Conversion for Mapping a Transparent Conducting Materials (TCM’s) Figure of Merit".

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any research projects in my field related to Photonics or Optics in some way. I have experience working with Python, MATLAB, MatPlotLib, NumPy, ScientificPython, SciPy, SQL, Tkiner, HTML, PHP, Javascript, CSS and C++.
